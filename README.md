#Complete Web Developer in 2018


Senior Developer Andrei Neagoie recently released this course. His objective is to teach people the most important and the most up-to-date technologies in web development, such as HTML5, CSS, ES6, React, and PostgreSQL. He also offers advice on how to get hired as a developer, which I find very useful.
